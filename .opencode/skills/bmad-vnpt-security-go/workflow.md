# bmad-vnpt-security-go

## Purpose
Review Go services for net/http handler chains, context propagation, unsafe template use, path handling, crypto misuse, and dependency vulnerabilities.

## Required Inputs
- the user request defining the audit scope
- the current source tree and relevant config/deployment files
- GitNexus MCP if available
- Serena MCP if available
- relevant framework docs/configs/architecture notes if they materially clarify behavior
- optional artifacts from Semgrep, Gitleaks, Trivy, govulncheck, ZAP, Nuclei, Scorecard, SBOM, or CI runs if available

## Hard Rules
- Prefer review first.
- GitNexus must be used first when available.
- Source or config files must be read to verify the main findings.
- Scanner output is supporting evidence, not the only evidence.
- If any behavior or environment assumption cannot be verified, say so explicitly.

## Mandatory Review Sequence
### Phase 1 — Stack scoping and likely assets
Internally define:
- target scope
- likely sensitive assets
- likely public entry points
- likely trust boundaries
- likely privileged flows
- likely external systems and side effects

### Phase 2 — GitNexus-first structural mapping
Use GitNexus first to identify:
- middleware/handler chain authz coverage, context propagation, identity binding, and object-level authorization
- html/template vs text/template, command execution, archive extraction, file/path joins, and SSRF via HTTP clients
- JWT/session/token parsing, secret/config loading, logging/redaction, and crypto/rand usage
- database query construction, goroutine races around authz/state, and dependency posture with govulncheck

### Phase 3 — Serena symbol-level verification
Use Serena only where needed to confirm exact ownership, callers/callees, references, framework wiring, or policy reuse.

### Phase 4 — Direct source/config verification
Read the returned hotspot files and verify actual behavior, especially around:
- router-level auth wrappers, public endpoints, internal admin/debug endpoints, and health/metrics exposure
- dangerous os/exec, ioutil/filepath traversal, template choice, and insecure TLS or http.Client defaults
- govulncheck-relevant hotspots and secrets/config sprawl

### Phase 5 — Corroborating evidence
Use bundled scripts and optional external tools where relevant, for example:
- detect_secrets.py
- scan_dependencies.py
- check_compliance.py
- validate_input_sanitization.py
- validate_security_headers.py
- infer_security_stack.py
- run_security_full_matrix.py

## Required Output Structure
A. Scope and assumptions
B. Architecture / trust-boundary map
C. Findings by severity with evidence
D. Exploitation notes / blast radius
E. Stack-specific remediation plan
F. Evidence used (files, scripts, external tool outputs)
G. Gaps / unknowns / what still needs manual verification

# bmad-vnpt-security-mobile-flutter

## Purpose
Review Flutter mobile apps for secret storage, deep links, platform-channel trust boundaries, WebView usage, release hardening, and backend auth flow handling.

## Required Inputs
- the user request defining the audit scope
- the current source tree and relevant config/deployment files
- GitNexus MCP if available
- Serena MCP if available
- relevant framework docs/configs/architecture notes if they materially clarify behavior
- optional artifacts from Semgrep, Gitleaks, Trivy, govulncheck, ZAP, Nuclei, Scorecard, SBOM, or CI runs if available

## Hard Rules
- Prefer review first.
- GitNexus must be used first when available.
- Source or config files must be read to verify the main findings.
- Scanner output is supporting evidence, not the only evidence.
- If any behavior or environment assumption cannot be verified, say so explicitly.

## Mandatory Review Sequence
### Phase 1 — Stack scoping and likely assets
Internally define:
- target scope
- likely sensitive assets
- likely public entry points
- likely trust boundaries
- likely privileged flows
- likely external systems and side effects

### Phase 2 — GitNexus-first structural mapping
Use GitNexus first to identify:
- token and secret storage, biometrics/keychain/keystore usage, local persistence, and offline data protection
- navigation/deep links, WebView/JS bridge, platform channels, FFI/native plugins, and trust boundaries to backend APIs
- certificate pinning/TLS posture, debug flags, logging, crash reports, release signing, and obfuscation posture
- sensitive permissions, exported Android/iOS components, file sharing, and content provider exposure

### Phase 3 — Serena symbol-level verification
Use Serena only where needed to confirm exact ownership, callers/callees, references, framework wiring, or policy reuse.

### Phase 4 — Direct source/config verification
Read the returned hotspot files and verify actual behavior, especially around:
- plain-text local storage, insecure shared prefs/files, and token leakage via logs or analytics
- deep-link/open-redirect abuse, WebView JS interfaces, and untrusted content rendering
- debug/dev endpoints, signing config, symbol exposure, and sensitive permissions

### Phase 5 — Corroborating evidence
Use bundled scripts and optional external tools where relevant, for example:
- detect_secrets.py
- scan_dependencies.py
- check_compliance.py
- validate_input_sanitization.py
- validate_security_headers.py
- infer_security_stack.py
- run_security_full_matrix.py

## Required Output Structure
A. Scope and assumptions
B. Architecture / trust-boundary map
C. Findings by severity with evidence
D. Exploitation notes / blast radius
E. Stack-specific remediation plan
F. Evidence used (files, scripts, external tool outputs)
G. Gaps / unknowns / what still needs manual verification
